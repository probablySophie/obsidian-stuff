<details>
<summary><code>lucide-generator.sh</code></summary>

[Go There!](./lucide-generator.sh)
> A bash script that will take a set of [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons and make an Obsidian CSS snippet that'll let you use those icons in your Obsidian callouts (providing Obsidian has the icon).  
> It'll also make you a markdown document showing off all the new callouts!  
> The colours *should* also be respectful of theme changes, as they reference internal colour variables like `--color-red`
> 
> The custom callouts are in the form `[!custom-ICONNAME-COLOUR]`, with the icon name not containing any dashes, and the order being important :)
>  
> `> [!custom-cat-purple]`
